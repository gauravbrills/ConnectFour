Introduction
The game of “Connect Four” involves two players dropping coloured tokens into a seven‐column, six‐row vertical
grid. Each token falls down the grid and occupies the bottom‐most place that does not already contain a token in
that column. The game was first sold under the famous “Connect Four” trademark by Milton Bradley in February
1974. It wasn’t until 1988 that it was proven mathematically that the first player, if they adopt a perfect strategy,
can always win by beginning in the middle column. So, why should you care? It is now your job to bring this game
to life again on the computer (surely no one else has thought of doing this)!
